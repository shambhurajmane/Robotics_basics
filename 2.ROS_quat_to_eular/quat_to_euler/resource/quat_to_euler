ros2 topic pub --once /quat_topic std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray "{data:[5.0, 6.0, 7.0]}"

Foundation of Robotics:

Description and purpose
Here I have created a subscriber as follows.
a node that converts quaternion representations to Euler angles representations.
â€¢ The subscriber will receive the message published on "/quat_topic" in quaternion representations in terms of array of float values. Which then will be converted into Euler angles representations.

How to build and run tests
Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 installation so that ros2 commands will work.
ros2 run quat_to_euler quat_subscriber

Required dependencies to be added in package.xml
<exec_depend>rclpy</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>std_msgs</exec_depend>

Required entry points to be added in setup.py
entry_points={
    	'console_scripts': [
            	'quat_subscriber = quat_to_euler.quat_2_eular:main'
    	],
},

Working of nodes
I have created one nodes, which is "quat_subscriber"
"subscription" subscribes the topic "quat_topic" and fetches the message data of type Float32MultiArray. Data from the quat_topic is accessed in the callback function "quat_callback". 
The frequency of incoming data is the frequency of the published topic. 
Received quaternian representations data is then accessed and converted into eular angles representation and printed on the terminal as roll, pitch and yaw values.
Message type  : Float32MultiArray (imported from std_msgs directory)
Topic name : quat_topic
Callback function : quat_callback
